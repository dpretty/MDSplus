To build the MDSPLUS PHP extension you should perform the following steps.

1) Download the source distribution for PHP. (This extension has only been tested
on PHP Version 4.3.7 on RHE Linux.)

2) Create an mdsplus subdirectory in the ext directory of the PHP source kit.

3) Copy the files in the mdsplus/php directory to this new mdsplus directory.

4) Configure the PHP build 
    In the top of the PHP source directory tree run the configure script using
    ./configure --with-mdsplus=/usr/local/mdsplus (or the directory where you
          have mdsplus installed)
    Note: You may want to use additional configure options to build additional
          modules as needed or to add the new php into your apache server.

5) Build and install php
    make
    make install

6) Try out the MDSplus php interface

   php < PHP_SOURCE_DIR/ext/mdsplus/sample.php

If you want to just build a loadable module for php you can do the following:

    cd PHP_SOURCE_DIR/ext/mdsplus
    ./build.sh

This should produce a mdsplus.so loadable module. You would use the dl()
function to load this module. Note the location that the dl() function uses
to find loadable modules is set in the php.ini configuration file. This may,
by default, be set to "./" which would require the module to be located
in the same directory as the php script being executed.
