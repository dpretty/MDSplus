Eventually this will have settings set by the configure script. It has only been built so far on linux (RHE 3).

Build by using:

make OPENSSL_DIR=directory-of-openssl-sources

Other platforms might require editting some settings in the config/ include files.

Currently this will fetch the modules from the head of the globus cvs repository.

It requires the ltdl library and includes from the libtools kit.
